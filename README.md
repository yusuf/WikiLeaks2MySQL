WikiLeaks2MySQL
===============

 Here is a ruby script for importing the wikileak cables.csv file to a MySQL database.
 
 You can grab the cable file from http://archive.org/details/wikileaks-cables-csv. 
 
 Purely done for educational purposes so feel free to experiment, modify and amend! A database with the name 'wikileak' is required, than again feel free to change. Enjoy!
